# BDS M1 Hackathon

## Business Data Science - Module 1 - Hackathon

This project was completed after only 2 weeks on the Data Science programme. The primary objective was to apply our newly acquired skills in Python, focusing on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization hereof using Streamlit.

As part of the EDA process, we conducted data preprocessing operations to ensure the data ready for further analysis. Subsequently, we employed various visualization techniques, such as charts and heatmaps, to gain a better understanding of the data and extract meaningful insights.

Overall, the project provided us with a valuable learning experience, allowing us to apply our theoretical knowledge of EDA and visualization techniques to real-world data
